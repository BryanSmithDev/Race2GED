        The GED® Mathematics Test is divided into two parts, each containing 25 questions. The parts
        are equally weighted.
        On Part 1 of the test you may use the Casio fx-60 calculator to help you compute your
        answers. Use of the calculator
        is not permitted on Part 2 of the Mathematics Test.\n
        \n
        The following areas are tested on the Mathematics Test:\n
        ● Number Operations and Number Sense: 20% - 30%\n
        ● Measurement and Geometry: 20% - 30%\n
        ● Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability: 20% - 30%\n
        ● Algebra, Functions, and Patterns: 20% - 30%\n
        \n
        80% of the questions are multiple choice. The remaining 20% of the answers are calculated
        and entered in an alternate
        format into a standard grid or coordinate plane.\n
        \n
        A total of 90 minutes is allowed for the GED® Mathematics Test – 45 minutes for Part I and
        45 minutes for Part II. A
        formula sheet, containing all the formulas that might be needed, is provided.
    </string>
    <string name="mathAltGuidelinesLabel">Alternate-Format Guidelines</string>
    <string formatted="false" name="mathAltGuidelines_info">
        On the Math portion of the GED® Test, 20% of the questions will require you to calculate
        your own answer, record that answer on
        a grid, and fill in the corresponding circles on the grid. Both Parts I and II will have
        these items.\n
        \n
        When using the standard grid:\n
        ● Begin in any column that will allow your entire answer to be entered.\n
        ● Write your answer in the boxes on the top row, including decimals and the slash for a
        fraction bar.\n
        ● In the column beneath the number or symbol that you have written into your answer, fill in
        the bubble representing that number or symbol.\n
        ● Leave any unused column blank.\n
        \n
        Remember:\n
        ● Your answer sheet will be machine scored, so the circles must be filled in correctly.\n
        ● Mark only one circle in each column.\n
        ● No answer will be a negative number\n
        ● Mixed numbers must be gridded as improper fractions or decimals. For example, 1 ½ would be
        gridded as either 3/2 or 1.5.\n
        ● Decimal numbers may be entered with or without a leading zero. For example, either 0.5 or
        .5 would be an acceptable answer. \n

        The Language Arts Reading Test is the shortest of the GED® Tests. It has 40 multiple choice
        questions that measure ability to comprehend and
        interpret workplace and academic reading selections and to apply those interpretations to
        new contexts. The questions ask you to understand,
        analyze, and synthesize information that you are given in the reading selections.\n

        How Shall Employees Conduct Themselves?\n

        appearance of a conflict of interest and might prompt accusations and / or an

    <string name="socinfo1_data">
        The history of the world is filled with stories of people migrating. Migration is the
        movement of people from one place to another as they seek a new home. Famine,
        overpopulation,
        limited resources, war, and religious and political persecution "push" immigrants to new
        places.\n
        \n
        Millions have migrated to North America since the 1600s. Spanish, French, English, and Dutch
        immigrants were the first European settlers to establish permanent colonies.
        They settled in lands originally populated by people from Asia. Many people from Africa were
        driven from their homes at this time to be enslaved to work in colonies in the
        Americas.\n
        \n
        Throughout the 1800s, immigrants looking for employment came to North America from Japan,
        China, and southeastern Europe. In the 1970s and 1980s, Southeast Asians, Latin
        Americans, and Caribbeans migrated to North America. Many of these immigrants fled from
        war-torn countries, political persecution, and economic difficulties.

    <string name="whatGedLabel">What are the GED® Tests?</string>
    <string name="whatged_info">
        The Tests of General Educational Development (GED®) are recognized internationally. They are
        designed to measure major academic skills and knowledge
        in the core content areas that are learned during the four years of high school. The GED®
        credential certifies that an adult who has passed the five
        tests of the GED® has mastered subject matter, knowledge, and skills associated with high
        school completion. The GED® Tests battery includes a test in
        each of the following subject area tests:\n\n
        ● Language Arts, Writing\n
        ● Language Arts, Reading\n
        ● Social Studies\n
        ● Science\n
        ● Mathematics\n
    </string>
    <string name="howGedLabel">How are the GED® Tests Scored?</string>
    <string name="howGed_info">
        The GED Testing Service® has established that a passing score on the GED® Test is a total
        score of 2250 for the five-test battery.
        This is an average of 450 with no single test score falling below 410. If any test score
        falls below 410, the test for that subject must be retaken
        to achieve a passing score.
    </string>
    <string name="newGedLabel">A New GED® Test is Coming in 2014</string>
    <string name="newGed_info">
        The GED® Tests battery is revised and updated about every ten years. On January 1, 2014, a
        new GED® Test is scheduled to replace the current version.
        This new test will be vastly different from today’s test. It will be computer based with no
        pencil and paper version available, and the
        content of the test will be even more challenging.\n
        \n
        The bad news about the updated test is that any incomplete scores on the current version of
        the test will be discarded. That means that
        folks who took parts of the GED® test before 2014, but did not complete all the subjects and
        those who took the entire test but had some
        failing (below 410) scores, will be required to start all over again with the new test. The
        bottom line is this: If you do not obtain a
        GED® credential before Jan 1, 2014, you will be required to take the entire battery of the
        2014 test.
